I. Scott MacKenzie and R. William Soukoreff point out some practical factors concerning evaluation and optimisation of text entry for mobile
comuputing. Firstly, it is mentioned that the methodology used for evaluation has to be reproducible and generalizable. This means that the method
can be reused to get the same results and the results also apply to other contexts outside of the controlled experiment.
It is then stated that text copy tasks should be prefered over text entry tasks, because they exclude "behaviours not required of the interaction 
technique" and errors can be indentified easier.
Regarding the selection of subjects MacKenzie and Soukoreff say, that the novice experience is more important "due to the target market". "Immediate
usability" is an important key factor.
When evaluating a text entry method, reasearchers should focus on both, quantitative and qualitative analyses. "Common pit-falls" like
inaccuracy, lack of control and baseline conditions have to be avoided.
The two primary evaluation metrics for text input are speed and accuracy. Speed can be measured in characters per second and words per minute whereat
five characters are interpreted as one word. Measuring accuracy can be done manually when the sample size is very small. Doing this manually has the
advantage that the basic types of errors made while entering text (substitution, omission, insertion, transposition) can be identified quite simple.
Doing this automatically can be complicated, but should be done for a larger sample size to avoid tabulation errors and speed up the evaluation.
Two possible approaches to optimising the text entry task are movement minimization and language prediction. There are also hybrid approaches.
In the mobile context minimizing the number of keys is also important. This can be done using ambiguous keys and mode keys (like SHIFT, ALT, NUM-LOCK).
The rest of the text then mentions some text entry technologies which are used in the mobile context.
