What does the term "critical path" describe with regard to GOMS?

Critical path is a concept for analyzing the task times of parallel tasks. "When activities occur in parallel,
one sequence of activities will take more time than parellel sequences of activites." The ciritical path is the
sequence of activities that takes the longest and it is used to measure the total time for a certain task. In this
paper this concept is used in combination with the GOMS to predict the performance of a tool for toll and assistance
operators (TAO). The critical path method is used to measure the total task times of the many parallel activites
of a TAO. On top of that the paper distinguishes between Cognition Perception an Motor operators and introduced
the term CPM-GOMS which also includes the Critical Path Method. The CPM-GOMS was able to make very accurate predictions
about the performance of a tool for TAOs.

Why might the original KLM not perfectly model input performance on a laptop? How could it be adapted?

There are several factors that can differ the original KLM model operator times by Card, Moran, Newell (1980) and
Kieras (2011) while using a laptop. First a modern laptop uses a different technology for its keyboard. Laptop
keyboards have much smaller travel times for keypresses and can differ from the original K operator. Often you dont
even use a real mouse while using a laptop. You just use the touchpad. And obviously the touchpad influences the
P and B operators times suggested by  Card, Moran, Newell (1980) and Kieras (2011). To adapt the original model
for the input performance on a laptop, the operator times just have to be measured again while using the typical
laptop periphery.
