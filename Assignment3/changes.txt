We made the following changes to improve our program:

- Our subjects had problems to remember which key they had to press during the tests. We changes the keys which had to "1" when
one rectangle appears and "2" when two rectangle appear (pre-attentive), as well as "1" when an uneven number appears and "2" when an even number appears
(attentive). These keys should be easier to map to the specific impulse.

- We added the timestamp in a format which is readable to humans to the log files (date and time).

- We only show the instructions for the full 30 seconds before the first condition. For the following conditions we
show the instructions for half of the time, because waiting for the instructions to disappear consumed most of the time while conducting the experiment.

- We let each proband test the program first to make sure they know what to do and what to expect.

- To avoid misconceptions during the evaluation of the data, we separate the order of the conditions for each subject with hyphens ("-") instead of
commas (","), because commas are already reserved to separate the columns in the CSV-files.
